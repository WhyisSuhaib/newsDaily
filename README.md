# Daily News App for Android

This Android app provides a daily dose of news, keeping users informed about the latest updates across various categories. It utilizes the [News API](https://newsapi.org/) to fetch real-time news data and presents it in a user-friendly interface.

## Features

- **Category-wise News:** The app allows users to explore news articles based on different categories, providing a tailored experience.

- **Headline News Channels:** Stay updated with the latest headlines from various news channels, offering a quick overview of the day's top stories.

## Implementation Details

### 1. API Integration

The app leverages the [News API](https://newsapi.org/) to seamlessly fetch news data. Two models, namely `categories_news_model` and `news_channel_headlines_model`, are employed to handle the retrieval and decoding of the data.

### 2. Design Pattern

The app follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern to ensure a well-organized and maintainable codebase. This separation of concerns enhances code readability and facilitates future modifications.

- **Model:** The models (`categories_news_model` and `news_channel_headlines_model`) are responsible for handling data retrieval, decoding, and management.

- **View:** The view component is responsible for presenting the data to the user through the user interface.

- **Controller:** Controllers manage the flow of data between the model and the view, ensuring proper communication and interaction.
